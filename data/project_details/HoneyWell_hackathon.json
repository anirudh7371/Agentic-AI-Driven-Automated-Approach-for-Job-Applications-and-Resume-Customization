    "Designed and deployed an end‑to‑end anomaly detection pipeline that trains a Random Forest classifier, scales features with StandardScaler, and computes per‑feature Z‑score deviations to assign weighted anomaly scores (1–100%) for Honeywell product quality data.",
    "Extracted the top 7 contributing features per anomaly and generated comprehensive output artifacts (model.pkl, scaler.pkl, stats.pkl, final_anomaly_output.csv) enabling rapid diagnostics and actionable insights for manufacturing teams.",
    "Optimized model performance and reproducibility by integrating feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and artifact serialization, resulting in a 15% reduction in false positives and a 20% increase in early defect detection."
